    <section>
      <p>When I upgraded to iOS 18, I lost a lot of music in my life. I use Spotify with a lot of automations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>One song when I got home</li>
        <li>Another when I connected to CarPlay</li>
        <li>One song to wake me up on Fridays and another for Mondays</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I wondered: "When will they bring back shortcuts that run without asking permission?" But no. It said "ask for permission, ask for permission," and they never came back. Music automations were only available for Apple Music. I remember a Reddit comment that said, "You can complain to Apple, but good luck with that."</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I refused to give up, and at first I waited, waited, waited, and nothing happened. Until I decided, gee, maybe I can create that thing. So I created this app, that does just that. It brings back ShortCuts that run on their own, that don't ask for permission, and that play the song directly.</p>
