    <section>
      <p>SpotiActions (“we”, “our”, or “the App”) is an iOS app that lets users create custom Shortcuts to play Spotify content (playlists, albums, artists) as alarms and automation actions. The app runs locally on the device and does not require a Spotify login or OAuth tokens to function.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>Data collection</h2>
    <p><strong>No personal data collected:</strong> The App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal user data to our servers. There is no account creation, sign-in, or backend service required to use the App.</p>

    <h2>Use of system features and third-party services</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The App uses <strong>iOS Shortcuts / AppIntents</strong> to create automation workflows locally on the device.</li>
      <li>The App may launch Spotify using URL schemes to play content. When invoking Spotify, playback and any related authorization are handled by the Spotify app or system; SpotiActions does not receive Spotify credentials or tokens.</li>
      <li>The App uses only the device's local capabilities; it does not upload user media, logs, or settings to external servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Analytics and advertising</h2>
    <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> include analytics SDKs, advertising SDKs, or crash reporting services that transmit user data off the device. If this changes in a future release, the privacy policy will be updated accordingly and users will be notified via the App Store release notes.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>The App may request permissions that are required for certain Shortcuts or automations (for example, access to play audio or to trigger Shortcuts). These permissions are managed by iOS and are explained at the point of use. The App itself does not request access to contacts, photos, location, or other personal data sources.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Because the App does not transmit or store personal data externally, there is no server-side user data to secure. Standard iOS platform protections apply to the local data and Shortcuts created on the device.</p>

    <h2>Export compliance</h2>
    <p>The App does not implement proprietary cryptography. It uses only standard iOS system services and APIs. For export compliance purposes, the App does not include or use non-standard encryption algorithms.</p>

    <h2>Support</h2>
    <p>For support, bug reports, or questions, please visit our project repository and open an issue:</p>
    <pre>https://github.com/gzalomoscoso/SpotiActions</pre>

    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The "Effective date" at the top will be updated when changes are published. Continued use of the App after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
